Finding a parking spot is the last pain point in the entire driving experience and creates 30% of all city traffic. AIPARK tackles this problem by providing drivers with accurate availability information for parking spots using a cloud-based platform. The system uses crowdsensing with 6+ Mio. connected devices, low-cost IoT sensors and CCTV video analysis to supply parking predictions and real-time availability data to extend existing mobility services on all platforms: Connected Vehicles, Mobile Apps and Traffic Management. Today, AIPARK already has 1 Mio. monthly active end-users through integrations with its B2B customers Volkswagen, Audi, Deutsche Bahn and plenty more.
