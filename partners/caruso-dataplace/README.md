Caruso is the Marketplace for the Mobility Ecosystem. Our Dataplace is a B2B brokering platform that does it all. Providing an open, neutral, state-of-the-art, secure and trusted marketplace for all participants, enabler for data delivery among providers and consumers, and, of course, taking care of billing and payment. Our marketplace supports the monetization of your connected & static vehicle data and services. We bring together all providers, harmonize their data, match them with customers and help identifying the market price for their offers â€“ all independent of the respective technology. Thus, we are the enabler for, not a competitor to, our partners.
